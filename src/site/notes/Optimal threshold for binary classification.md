# Thresholds should consider cost of errors
Optimal beta from signal detection theory 

- Risky picks or conservative picks
- Value of TP versus cost of FP.  How many TP to balance a FP? 50/50?
- Value of TN versus cost of a FN
$Bopt = P(N)/P(S) X (V(CR) +C(FA))/((V(H) + C(M)))$

G-Mean = sqrt(Sensitivity * Specificity) can be optimized by calculating its value across the AUC and selecting the threshold that gives the highest value
